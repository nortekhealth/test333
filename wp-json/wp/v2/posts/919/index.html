The safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of medical gas engineering are becoming increasingly important. This article explores the key aspects of medical gas engineering, including oxygen supply diversification, vacuum suction, compressed air supply, and operational management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Oxygen Supply Diversification<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Oxygen is a critical medical gas. Hospitals typically obtain oxygen through various methods, including electronic means, pressure swing adsorption, low-temperature air separation, chemical preparations, and membrane permeation. The choice of method affects the cost and energy consumption, with manifold oxygen supply being the most expensive due to the high pressure required for gasification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regulations for medical liquid oxygen storage tanks in healthcare institutions stipulate that the volume of a single tank should not exceed 5m\u00b3, with a total volume limit of 20m\u00b3. The distance between adjacent tanks should be at least three times the diameter of the largest tank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vacuum Suction Supply<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vacuum suction technology has reduced the reliance on compressed air machines as the primary source of medical gas pollution. However, vacuum suction pumping stations, where hospital waste liquid and gas are concentrated, can be potential sources of infection. It is crucial to locate these stations in relatively independent areas and ensure proper waste liquid collection and treatment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Compressed Air Supply<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The quality of compressed air in hospitals is vital for patient treatment. Various air compressors are available, with sliding vane air compressors being popular for their quiet operation and low cost. Ensuring the quality of compressed air involves controlling air supply and exhaust to maintain slight positive pressure in the compressor room and interlocking the compressor with air supply and exhaust fans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Medical Gas Supply in the Operating Department<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The operating department requires a reliable supply of various medical gases, including N2O, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium, and anesthesia waste gas collection. It is recommended to set the gas manifold in or near the central operating department for convenient management and oxygen supply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Medical Gas Supply Pipeline<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The pipeline for medical gas supply should be made of materials like seamless copper pipes and meet specific safety and installation standards. The layout should be flexible, especially for oxygen pipelines, to prevent accumulation and concentration of oxygen, which can be hazardous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Medical Gas User Terminal Safety<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The setting of hospital medical gas terminals should ensure safety, reliability, visibility, and aesthetics. Preventing wrong connections, ensuring reliable dosage, and making the terminals easily identifiable are key principles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Medical Gas Operation Management and Monitoring<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Efficient operation management and monitoring of medical gas involve classifying oxygen supply, managing compression processes, and monitoring vacuum situations. Energy-saving measures, such as adopting frequency conversion technology and selecting energy-saving products, can help reduce costs and environmental impact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The operation and management of medical gas engineering require attention to safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Hospitals should adopt best practices in supply diversification, vacuum suction, compressed air supply, and monitoring to ensure the optimal use of medical gases for patient care.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The application of medical gases in healthcare settings is expanding, driven by patient needs and advancements in medical technology.
